# 🧠 Sentiment Analysis for Brand Perception  

## 🏢 Internship Context  
This project was developed during my **remote internship at [Prodigy InfoTech](https://prodigyinfotech.dev)** as part of my role as a **Data Science & AI Intern**.  
The objective was to analyze **public sentiment toward a brand** using advanced **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** techniques.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview  
- Processed and analyzed **74,000+ tweets** related to brand perception.  
- Applied **VADER** and **TF-IDF with Logistic Regression** for sentiment classification.  
- Extracted **insightful patterns** about public opinions and brand reputation.  
- Visualized sentiment distribution to interpret audience perception effectively.

## 🧩 Tech Stack  
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, nltk, matplotlib, seaborn  
- **Techniques:** NLP, Sentiment Analysis, TF-IDF, Logistic Regression

## 🧠 Methodology  
1. **Data Collection & Cleaning** – Removed duplicates, special characters, and stopwords.  
2. **Preprocessing** – Tokenization, normalization, and text vectorization (TF-IDF).  
3. **Model Training** – Logistic Regression for multi-class sentiment classification.  
4. **Evaluation** – Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
5. **Visualization** – Plots showing sentiment distribution and brand perception trends.
